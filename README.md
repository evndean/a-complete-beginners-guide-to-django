# A Complete Beginner's Guide to Django

Working through the Django tutorial [A Complete Beginner's Guide to Django](https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/series/beginners-guide/1.11/). I also used the guides [Get started with Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/) and [Quickstart: Compose and Django](https://docs.docker.com/compose/django/) to set up a Docker container for doing development work.

## Docker commands

* `docker-compose up -d` to start the services running in the background.
* `docker-compose stop` to stop the services.
* `docker-compose down --volues` to remove containers, including the data volume used by the Redis container.
